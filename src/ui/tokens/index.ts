/**
 * The design tokens (ADR-0003), tier by tier:
 *   primitives.ts  the raw OKLCH palette and the paper
 *   scale.ts       space, radius, elevation, motion, type
 *   semantic.ts    what a colour means, per theme — the only tier components may name
 *   color.ts       OKLCH → sRGB, luminance, WCAG contrast (used by the generator and gate)
 *
 * Components read colour through Tailwind utilities backed by `--color-*`, never by importing from
 * here. These exports exist for the code that genuinely needs a *value*: the token generator, the
 * contrast gate, Storybook's swatch docs, and PDF/QR rendering where CSS variables cannot reach.

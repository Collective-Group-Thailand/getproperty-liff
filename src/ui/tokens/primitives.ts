/**
 * Tier 1 — primitives: the raw palette and nothing else.
 *
 * Authored in OKLCH (ADR-0003) so every palette keeps one perceived lightness ramp across hues:
 * `red-700` and `brand-700` are equally dark, which is what makes the semantic tier swappable and the
 * contrast gate predictable. Never reference a primitive from a component — go through
 * `semantic.ts`, or the gate cannot see what you did.
 *
 * The brand hues come from the founder's logo (docs/brand, 2026-10-21; docs/ui/brand.md): the
 * lettering's navy and the house's blue drive actions, links and the focus ring, the chimney's sky is
 * the dark-theme accent. Warm neutrals for the page, amber for "needs attention". No getpack colour is
 * in here (D-003). The logo's hex values are pasted verbatim through `hexToOklch`.

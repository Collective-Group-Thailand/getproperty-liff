/**
 * Tier 1 — primitives: the raw palette and nothing else.
 *
 * Authored in OKLCH (ADR-0003) so every palette keeps one perceived lightness ramp across hues:
 * `red-700` and `teal-700` are equally dark, which is what makes the semantic tier swappable and the
 * contrast gate predictable. Never reference a primitive from a component — go through
 * `semantic.ts`, or the gate cannot see what you did.
 *
 * These are getproperty's own placeholder hues (D-100, docs/ui/brand.md): a calm teal-green for
 * actions, warm neutrals for the page, amber for "needs attention". No getpack colour is in here
 * (D-003). When the brand kit lands, `hexToOklch` lets its values be pasted verbatim.

 * Self-hosted Thai-first typography (ADR-0001, one typeface since 2026-10-24). No runtime Google Fonts in any zone;
 * the three woff2 files come from the `@fontsource-variable/*` npm packages through `scripts/copy-fonts.ts`.
 *
 * Each family is split by script, and the stacks in `src/ui/tokens/scale.ts` put Latin first: ASCII
 * comes from the Latin companion, and Thai codepoints fall through to the Thai file. That ordering is
 * what replaces `unicode-range` — `next/font/local` applies its `declarations` to every `src` entry of
 * a call, so it cannot give two files in one family different ranges.
 *
 * None of these declarations names a generic fallback: `next/font/local` would splice it into that
 * family's own variable, ahead of the Thai family in the stack, and `system-ui` on a Thai system
 * *does* have Thai glyphs — so Thai text would never reach Anuphan's Thai file. The generics belong at
 * the end of `--font-sans` / `--font-display` / `--font-mono` instead.
